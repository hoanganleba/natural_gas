## Motivation

As a quantitative researcher on the commodity trading desk, I am tasked with enhancing the granularity and quality of market data for pricing natural gas storage contracts. These contracts are pivotal for clients across the supply chain, including producers, refiners, transporters, and distributors, as well as trading firms aiming to capitalize on seasonal price differentials. By extrapolating available external feeds and accounting for seasonal trends, we can provide the necessary insights to price these contracts accurately. This will empower our trading desk to better serve our clients and leverage opportunities within the natural gas market.
